Default cache size is too small - results in screwy error code as well,
and/or assertion errors in hash.c.  Btserve should check for big enough
cache at startup.

Giving a non-existant file for root file system causes a core dump.

Currently, PID is used as a session/transaction identifier.  This will
not work for multithreaded programs (e.g. Java) or for a UDP socket protocol.
The msgq protocol must continue to use PID to get messages back to the
sender, and a socket protocol must use IPaddr,port.  (If an arbitrary
id is assigned, how would the negotiation result get back to the client
for msgq?)  The only solution is to add a "transaction id" to each request
packet.  This causes either code compatibility problems, or extra copying.
One solution is to implement this for UDP, and require multithreaded apps
to use UDP.  

Will a unix domain socket be faster or slower than msgq?  Only one way
to find out . . .
